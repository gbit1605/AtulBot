It specializes in the manufacture of dye, dye intermediates, agricultural as well as aromatic chemicals. 
Manufacturing industries such as Atic Industries and Citabul were also boosted and aided by Atul in 1956 and 1960 respectively. 
Atic Industry was a manufacturer of dyes and it sold a large bulk of dye to Atul all the times, thereby making the latter, a shareholder of 50% of its capital.

In 1988-89, Gujarat Aromatics was amalgamated into Atul, due to the drastic decline of the former. Gujarat Aromatics had an expertise in the production of mixed cresols out of toluene which unfortunately had no market demand.
